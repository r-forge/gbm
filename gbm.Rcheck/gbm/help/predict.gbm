_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Predicted values based on a generalized boosted model object

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'gbm':
     predict(object,
             newdata,
             n.trees,
             type="link",
             single.tree=FALSE,
             ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: Object of class inheriting from ('gbm.object') 

 newdata: Data frame of observations for which to make predictions 

 n.trees: Number of trees used in the prediction. 'n.trees' may be a
          vector in which case predictions are returned for each
          iteration specified

    type: The scale on which gbm makes the predictions 

single.tree: If 'single.tree=TRUE' then 'predict.gbm' returns only the
          predictions from tree(s) 'n.trees'

     ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'predict.gbm' produces predicted values for each observation in
     'newdata' using the the first 'n.trees' iterations of the boosting
     sequence. If 'n.trees' is a vector than the result is a matrix
     with each column representing the predictions from gbm models with
     'n.trees[1]' iterations, 'n.trees[2]' iterations, and so on.

     The predictions from 'gbm' do not include the offset term. The
     user may add the value of the offset to the predicted value if
     desired.

     If 'object' was fit using 'gbm.fit' there will be no 'Terms'
     component. Therefore, the user has greater responsibility to make
     sure that 'newdata' is of the same format (order and number of
     variables) as the one originally used to fit the model.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Returns a vector of predictions. By default the predictions are on
     the scale of f(x). For example, for the Bernoulli loss the
     returned value is on the log odds scale, poisson loss on the log
     scale, and coxph is on the log hazard scale.

     If 'type="response"' then 'gbm' converts back to the same scale as
     the outcome. Currently the only effect this will have is returning
     probabilities for bernoulli and expected counts for poisson. For
     the other distributions "response" and "link" return the same.
