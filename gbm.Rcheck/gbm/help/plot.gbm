_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plots the marginal effect of the selected variables by
     "integrating" out the other variables.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'gbm':
     plot(x,
          i.var = 1,
          n.trees = x$n.trees,
          continuous.resolution = 100,
          return.grid = FALSE,
          type = "link",
          ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a 'gbm.object' fitted using a call to 'gbm'

   i.var: a vector of indices or the names of the variables to plot. If
          using indices, the variables are indexed in the same order
          that they appear in the initial 'gbm' formula. If
          'length(i.var)' is between 1 and 3 then 'plot.gbm' produces
          the plots. Otherwise, 'plot.gbm' returns only the grid of
          evaluation points and their average predictions

 n.trees: the number of trees used to generate the plot. Only the first
          'n.trees' trees will be used

continuous.resolution: The number of equally space points at which to
          evaluate continuous predictors 

return.grid: if 'TRUE' then 'plot.gbm' produces no graphics and only
          returns the grid of evaluation points and their average
          predictions. This is useful for customizing the graphics for
          special variable types or for dimensions greater than 3 

    type: the type of prediction to plot on the vertical axis. See
          'predict.gbm'

     ...: other arguments passed to the plot function 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'plot.gbm' produces low dimensional projections of the
     'gbm.object' by integrating out the variables not included in the
     'i.var' argument. The function selects a grid of points and uses
     the weighted tree traversal method described in Friedman (2001) to
     do the integration. Based on the variable types included in the
     projection, 'plot.gbm' selects an appropriate display choosing
     amongst line plots, contour plots, and 'lattice' plots. If the
     default graphics are not sufficient the user may set
     'return.grid=TRUE', store the result of the function, and develop
     another graphic display more appropriate to the particular
     example.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Nothing unless 'return.grid' is true then 'plot.gbm' produces no
     graphics and only returns the grid of evaluation points and their
     average predictions.
