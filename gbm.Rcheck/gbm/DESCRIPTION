Author: Greg Ridgeway <gregr@rand.org> with contributions from others
Maintainer: Harry Southworth <harry.southworth@googlemail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), survival, lattice, splines
Description: This package implements extensions to Freund and
        Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting
        machine. Includes regression methods for least squares,
        absolute loss, bisquare loss, t-distribution loss, quantile
        regression, logistic, multi-class logistic, Poisson, Cox
        proportional hazards partial likelihood, and AdaBoost
        exponential loss.
