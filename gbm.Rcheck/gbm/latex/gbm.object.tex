\begin{Description}\relax
These are objects representing fitted \code{gbm}s.
\end{Description}
\begin{Value}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{initF}] the "intercept" term, the initial predicted value to which trees
make adjustments
\item[\code{fit}] a vector containing the fitted values on the scale of regression
function (e.g. log-odds scale for bernoulli, log scale for poisson)
\item[\code{train.error}] a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
containing the value of the loss function for each boosting iteration
evaluated on the training data
\item[\code{valid.error}] a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
containing the value of the loss function for each boosting iteration
evaluated on the validation data
\item[\code{cv.error}] if \code{cv.folds}<2 this component is NULL. Otherwise, this 
component is a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
containing a cross-validated estimate of the loss function for each boosting 
iteration
\item[\code{oobag.improve}] a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
containing an out-of-bag estimate of the marginal reduction in the expected
value of the loss function. The out-of-bag estimate uses only the training
data and is useful for estimating the optimal number of boosting iterations.
See \code{\LinkA{gbm.perf}{gbm.perf}}
\item[\code{trees}] a list containing the tree structures. The components are best
viewed using \code{\LinkA{pretty.gbm.tree}{pretty.gbm.tree}}
\item[\code{c.splits}] a list of all the categorical splits in the collection of
trees. If the \code{trees[[i]]} component of a \code{gbm} object describes a
categorical split then the splitting value will refer to a component of
\code{c.splits}. That component of \code{c.splits} will be a vector of length
equal to the number of levels in the categorical split variable. -1 indicates
left, +1 indicates right, and 0 indicates that the level was not present in the
training data
