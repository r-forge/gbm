     'gbm' stores the collection of trees used to construct the model
     in a  compact matrix structure. This function extracts the
     information from a single tree and displays it in a slightly more
     readable form. This function is mostly for debugging purposes and
     to satisfy some users' curiosity.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     pretty.gbm.tree(object, 
                     i.tree = 1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: a 'gbm.object' initially fit using 'gbm'

  i.tree: the index of the tree component to extract from 'object'  and
          display 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     'pretty.gbm.tree' returns a data frame. Each row corresponds to a
     node in  the tree. Columns indicate 

SplitVar: index of which variable is used to split. -1 indicates a 
          terminal node.

SplitCodePred: if the split variable is continuous then this component
          is the split point. If the split variable is categorical then
          this component contains the index of 'object$c.split' that
          describes the categorical split. If the node is a terminal
          node then this is the prediction.

LeftNode: the index of the row corresponding to the left node.

RightNode: the index of the row corresponding to the right node.

ErrorReduction: the reduction in the loss function as a result of 
          splitting this node.

  Weight: the total weight of observations in the node. If weights are
          all equal to 1 then this is the number of observations in the
          node.
