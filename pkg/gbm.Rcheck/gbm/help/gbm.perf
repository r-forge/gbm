_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Estimates the optimal number of boosting iterations for a 'gbm'
     object and optionally plots various performance measures

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gbm.perf(object, 
              plot.it = TRUE, 
              oobag.curve = FALSE, 
              overlay = TRUE, 
              method)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: a 'gbm.object' created from an initial call to  'gbm'.

 plot.it: an indicator of whether or not to plot the performance
          measures. Setting 'plot.it=TRUE' creates two plots. The first
          plot plots  'object$train.error' (in black) and
          'object$valid.error' (in red)  versus the iteration number.
          The scale of the error measurement, shown on the  left
          vertical axis, depends on the 'distribution' argument used in
          the  initial call to 'gbm'.

oobag.curve: indicates whether to plot the out-of-bag performance
          measures in a second plot.

 overlay: if TRUE and oobag.curve=TRUE then a right y-axis is added to
          the  training and test error plot and the estimated
          cumulative improvement in the loss  function is plotted
          versus the iteration number.

  method: indicate the method used to estimate the optimal number of
          boosting iterations. 'method="OOB"' computes the out-of-bag
          estimate and 'method="test"' uses the test (or validation)
          dataset  to compute an out-of-sample estimate. 'method="cv"'
          extracts the  optimal number of iterations using
          cross-validation if 'gbm' was called with 'cv.folds'>1

_V_a_l_u_e:

     'gbm.perf' returns the estimated optimal number of iterations. The
     method  of computation depends on the 'method' argument.
