_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     These are objects representing fitted 'gbm's.

_V_a_l_u_e:

   initF: the "intercept" term, the initial predicted value to which
          trees make adjustments

     fit: a vector containing the fitted values on the scale of
          regression function (e.g. log-odds scale for bernoulli, log
          scale for poisson)

train.error: a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
          containing the value of the loss function for each boosting
          iteration evaluated on the training data

valid.error: a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
          containing the value of the loss function for each boosting
          iteration evaluated on the validation data

cv.error: if 'cv.folds'<2 this component is NULL. Otherwise, this 
          component is a vector of length equal to the number of fitted
          trees containing a cross-validated estimate of the loss
          function for each boosting  iteration

oobag.improve: a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
          containing an out-of-bag estimate of the marginal reduction
          in the expected value of the loss function. The out-of-bag
          estimate uses only the training data and is useful for
          estimating the optimal number of boosting iterations. See
          'gbm.perf'

   trees: a list containing the tree structures. The components are
          best viewed using 'pretty.gbm.tree'

c.splits: a list of all the categorical splits in the collection of
          trees. If the 'trees[[i]]' component of a 'gbm' object
          describes a categorical split then the splitting value will
          refer to a component of 'c.splits'. That component of
          'c.splits' will be a vector of length equal to the number of
          levels in the categorical split variable. -1 indicates left,
          +1 indicates right, and 0 indicates that the level was not
          present in the training data

_S_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e:

     The following components must be included in a legitimate 'gbm'
     object.
